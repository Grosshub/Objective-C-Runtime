This application created to show the power of Objective-C Runtime. This is not about the user interface, this is about the code. I tried to make a visual representation of my code, not vice versa. Runtime allows you to make an introspection of objects/classes or modify them when the app is already running (not in compile time). The most powerful Runtime feature as for me is a message forwarding mechanism which is presented in code too.
